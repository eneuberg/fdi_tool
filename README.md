# First Prototype for the FDI Tool
This is the first prototype for the FDI Tool. We currently assume that we will not use any additional technical resources other than those used here. It therefore provides a good first impression of our final result but we still have pending Items whitch will/could influence the code.

## Pending Items:
- CSS elements need to be added
- The results page is not yet accessible
- At the request of Heather and Tom:
    - There should be a division into dimensions of the Excel file. This may require additional TypeScript code. Furthermore, the entire code structure may change.
    - There should be a preliminary website. However, we will implement this only next week, as we want to focus first on the full functionality of the form.

## Starting the Local Development Environment
This is a client-side application using TypeScript.

### Tech Stack
- *Node.js*
- *TypeScript*
- *Parcel*

### Setup
- Ensure Node.js is installed (https://nodejs.org)
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Use the build/start scripts defined in `package.json` to build and start the      application
